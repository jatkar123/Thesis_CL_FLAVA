# Thesis_CL_FLAVA
This repository is dedicated towards keeping the code infrastructure for my Master Thesis--> "How Continual Learning affects FLAVA"
Insert more about the topics here...

## Folder Structure and Notebook Description:  
1) Image Classification FLAVA:
   (i) Flava_ImageClassification_MNIST_with_comments.ipynb--> This notebook explores inferencing of FLAVA Image encoder model (i.e ViT B-16 model) on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset with a logistic regression classifier head (as mentioned in the FLAVA paper). On both these datasets the FLAVA model gives great results (~95%+ accuracy) in zero-shot inference but one thing which needs to be taken into consideration is that FLAVA  model has already been trained on these models, so this doesn't completely justify its efficacy.
    Markup : * Goal achieved--> Learnt how the FLAVA model API's work and how exactly is it structured and how I can modify it accoring to my thesis requirements.
